Here will be station projects for gsl-12

# Python station project 1: Mad Libs for GSL-12
# Mad Libs is a game with a basic story template that has blank spaces which 
# need to be filled by the user. The user inputs words without knowing the story.

# The task:
# Write a program on Python that does the following:
# 1. Allows the user to pick one of the templates
# 2. Asks the user to input words. “Type number”, for example
# 3. Generate a story afterwards and shows it to the user

# Make sure your program follows these 3 conditions. You will have to use the 
# “random” library, and the only functions you’ll be able to use will be 
# print() and input().
